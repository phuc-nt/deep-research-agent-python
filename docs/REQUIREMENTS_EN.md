# Requirements Document - Deep Research Agent

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Deep Research Agent is an intelligent system designed to perform in-depth research and create high-quality analytical content. The system supports a complete process from analyzing research requirements to creating outlines, detailed research, and editing the final article.

### 1.2 Scope
This document describes in detail the functional and non-functional requirements necessary to develop the Deep Research Agent system, including:
- Overall architecture
- Main components of the system
- API endpoints and interaction flows
- Integrated services (LLM, Search, Storage)
- Research process and data processing
- Deployment and Docker requirements

### 1.3 Required Technologies
- Python 3.11.10 or higher
- FastAPI framework
- Python libraries listed in requirements.txt
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Async/Await framework

## 2. Overall Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Model

The system will be developed according to a layered architecture model:
1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and routing
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic for research processes
3. **Core Services**: Foundation services (LLM, Search, Storage, Monitoring)
4. **Models**: Pydantic models representing data

Backend Services include:
- Prepare Service: Analyzes requirements and creates outlines
- Research Service: Performs detailed research
- Edit Service: Edits and synthesizes content
- Storage Service: Stores and manages data
- Cost Monitoring Service: Tracks API usage costs

Integrated services:
- LLM Service (OpenAI, Claude)
- Search Service (Perplexity, Google)
- Storage Service (File System, GitHub)
```

## 3. Functional Requirements

2. `GET /api/v1/research/{research_id}`: Get detailed information about a research
3. `GET /api/v1/research/{research_id}/status`: Check the status of research
4. `GET /api/v1/research/{research_id}/progress`: Get detailed progress information
5. `GET /api/v1/research/{research_id}/outline`: Get research outline
6. `GET /api/v1/research/{research_id}/cost`: Get cost information
7. `GET /api/v1/research`: Get a list of researches
